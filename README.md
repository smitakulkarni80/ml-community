## Some Guideline
* Make sure to give appropriate ipython notebook names
* If more than one ipython notebook on same topic then use superscript as Ex1-LinReg.ipynb
* Don't use spaces in names, keep naming simple and relavant
* Avoid merging topics and create different ipython nb's for different example
* Make sure to provide proper notes and explanation of your works (use images, formulas, graphs for illustration)
* Materials of respective topics should be collected and maintained (use "Docs")
* Use Table for multiple entries in Docs
* Any pre-requisite or miscellaneous requirements should be listed in Docs -> requirements.md file
